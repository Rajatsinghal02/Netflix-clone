**Netflix Homepage Clone**

This project is a replica of the Netflix homepage, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user interface similar to Netflix, allowing users to explore content categories and potentially interact with basic functionalities (depending on your implementation).

**Features:**

Replicates the layout and style of the Netflix homepage.
May include elements like carousels showcasing featured content.
Might have basic interactive features powered by JavaScript (e.g., hover effects, navigation).

**Getting Started**

Clone the Repository: Use Git to clone this repository to your local machine.


git clone https://github.com/rajatsinghal02/Netflix-clone.git

Open the Project: Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

**Dependencies:**

Images: The project likely uses images for the Netflix logo, background visuals, and potentially movie/show thumbnails. These should be included in the project directory.

**Usage:**

The website is a static mockup and won't have full functionality like the real Netflix. Users will experience the replicated layout and potentially basic interactions you've implemented.

**Contributing**

We welcome contributions to this project! Feel free to open a pull request with:

Improved CSS styling to closely mimic the Netflix design.

Additional JavaScript functionalities (consider legal and ethical implications, as this is a mockup).

Enhancements to the user experience (e.g., hover effects, navigation).
